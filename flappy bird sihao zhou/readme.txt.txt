Project Description:

My project is Flappy Bird. It is a game where a "bird" is jumping through pipes. 
If the bird hits on the pipe or the edge of the screen, the game ends and returns a score. 
The way that the bird jumps is that it will automatically falls down if the player does not click the screen, 
and if the player clicks the screen, the bird will go up by a little bit. A couple other features will include enemies; 
that is,  if the bird hits the enemies, it will be game over and the game would restart.

The main game is in the file "flappy bird sihao zhou" and it must be in the same folder with the cmu_112_graphics file.
